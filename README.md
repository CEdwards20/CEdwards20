My Github account is brand new, and I am going to use it to complete LAB Assignments for my CTI 110 course in the future.

This repository is my very first one. It doesn't have anything in it besides this README

To clone this repository, I first had to create this original one, then I clicked the "Clone Repository" option in the corner of the screen on Github.com. Then I chose the local folder I wanted to save the repository to and cloned it by selecting the
"Clone Repository" option again.
